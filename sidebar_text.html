<p>Use this tool to help determine the correct amounts of expenses, taxable scholarship, and nontaxable scholarship to enter into TaxSlayer to maximize the benefit of education credits. <b>Do not start this tool until everything else is complete for the return, including MN credits and the M1PR if applicable.</b></p> 
<p>First, enter tuition and scholarship information from the 1098-T and other expense information in the top section. Next, answer the two checkbox questions and press 'Generate Taxslayer Values'.</p>
<p>In the boxes below, values for Qualified Education Expenses, Taxable Scholarship to be reported as income, and Nontaxable scholarship to potentially report on the M1PR will be displayed. Enter these values into TaxSlayer, then record the final refund and/or balance due amounts for each return. The tool will then calculate which option is most advantageous for the taxpayer and dependent.</p>
