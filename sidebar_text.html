<p>Use this tool to help determine the correct amounts of expenses, taxable scholarship, and nontaxable scholarship to enter into TaxSlayer to maximize the benefit of education credits. <b>Do not start this tool until everything else is complete for the return, including MN credits and the M1PR if applicable.</b></p> 
<p>First, enter tuition and scholarship information from the 1098-T and other expense information in the top section. Next, select whether the student is the taxpayer or the taxpayer's dependent and click "Generate TaxSlayer Entry Values."</p>
<p>The calculator will compute values for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eligible Education Expenses (enter as Tuition Paid in the Education Credits section)</li>
  <li>Taxable Scholarship (enter as Other Compensation > Scholarships and Grants–NOT OTHER INCOME)</li>
  <li>Nontaxable Scholarship (enter on Form M1PR if student is a homeowner; otherwise do not enter anywhere)</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter each set of values into TaxSlayer, then record the final refund and/or balance due amounts for each return. <b>The calculator requires that a value be entered for each return. If a return is not applicable enter 0.</b> The tool will then calculate which option is most advantageous for the taxpayer and dependent</p>
<p>When you are finished, transfer all values to the AOC Calculator Input Sheet.</p>
